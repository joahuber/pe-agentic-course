Deliberately broken application — used in the Module 4 DEMO.

This file contains TWO intentional NameErrors. Do not fix them.
The Module 4 triage agent (diagnose.py) will read the CI failure log
produced when this script runs and identify both bugs.

Bug 1: line 22 — `statis = statis + 1`
  'statis' is not defined. The variable was never initialised.
  Fix: `status_count = status_count + 1` (or just `count += 1`)

Bug 2: line 35 — `version = app_version`
  'app_version' is not defined. The constant is APP_VERSION (all caps).
  Fix: `version = APP_VERSION`

These are HIGH-confidence bugs — deterministic NameErrors with a clear fix.
Contrast with the exercise (OOMKill) where confidence is correctly MEDIUM.
